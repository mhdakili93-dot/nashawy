If you signed in to our Service with Facebook/Instagram, you can request deletion of your data at any time.

How to request deletion
1) Email Osstemlb@gmail.com with the subject: Delete my Facebook/Instagram App data.
2) Include your Facebook/Instagram user ID or the email associated with your Facebook/Instagram account so we can identify your data.
3) We will confirm and delete associated data within 30 days (or sooner where required by law).

Identity verification
We may ask for reasonable information to verify you are the account owner before deleting data.

What gets deleted
We delete or anonymize account profile data, logs linked to your identity, and content stored for your use of the Service, unless retention is required for legal obligations, dispute resolution, fraud prevention, or security.

What may be retained
Minimal records may be retained if necessary to comply with law, resolve disputes, or maintain security (for example, de‑identified logs).

Additional controls
You can review and revoke permissions you granted to the Service from your Facebook account settings.
